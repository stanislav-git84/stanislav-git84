- 👋 Hi, my name is Stanislav and work as Program Manager in automotive industry.
> I am enthusiastic about innovative technologies and love to see how these are moving humanity further.
> I took several programming courses during my university time and recently on Coursera, but I still consider my programming skills to be rather basic and my experience in coding as rather limited. 

- 👀 I’m interested in Product Ownership, Applications development and Software Engineering in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to create and manage delivery pipeline using Jenkins server.

- 💞️ I’m looking for opportunities to collaborate on any open-source project where my limited experience can be put into practice and hopefully be of any contribution.
- 📫 How to reach me...
